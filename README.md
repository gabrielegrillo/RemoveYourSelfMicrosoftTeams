# MS-RemoveYourselfFromATeam

I've made this prototype with no error handling. 

Does it get stuck or it does show any errors? Resolve it diy.

## Usage

On Windows:
```cmd
powershell RemoveYourselfFromTeam.ps1
```
On MacOS or Linux (install before powershell)
```bash
pwsh RemoveYourselfFromTeam.ps1
```
